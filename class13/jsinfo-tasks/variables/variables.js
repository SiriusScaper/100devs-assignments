// Working with variables
// importance: 2

// Declare two variables: admin and name.
let admin

let name
// Assign the value "John" to name.
name = "John"

// Copy the value from name to admin.
admin = name

// Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).
alert(admin)


// Giving the right name
// importance: 3

// Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
const ourPlanet = "Earth"

// Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?
let currentUserName = "Ryan"

// Uppercase const?
// importance: 4

// Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?
// No, given the definition in the article using uppercase is reserved for values that are known beforehand. Deriving age from a birthdate wouldn't qualify, but the birthday might since it's not going to change and could be hardcoded.
